// Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
// You can increase the temperature with an up function
// You can decrease the temperature with a down function
// The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
// If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
// If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
// Power saving mode is on by default
// You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function
// You can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is low-usage, < 25 is medium-usage, anything else is high-usage.
// (In the challenges where we add an interface, low-usage will be indicated with green, medium-usage indicated with black, high-usage indicated with red.)
